        <p>
          Absolute Robotics has wide reach in both its local and global
          community. At each regional competition alone, Absolute Robotics
          interacts with several supporting business and organizations, dozens
          of local robotics teams, and hundreds of fellow high school students,
          mentors, and industry professionals.

            <p>
              Absolute Robotics strives to promote STEM within the community by
              creating a positive learning environment where students can pursue
              their passion for STEM and develop their skills in engineering,
              programming, design, and business.

            <p>
              Absolute Robotics wants to continue being able to provide the
              opportunity for our community to experience what it is like to be
              a part of a world-class robotics team. Through lessons from senior
              members and mentors, engagement in the design and building of
              complex mechatronic systems, and participation in exciting
              competitions, we want to give them skills and experiences that
              they wouldnâ€™t get anywhere else.

        <h1 style="text-align: center"><u>HOW TO SPONSOR</u></h1>
        <p>
          There are countless ways that you can give us a hand! The operation of
          an FRC robotics team is a costly endeavor, so financial sponsorships
          would go a long way towards helping us achieving our goals.
          Non-monetary sponsorships are also greatly appreciated as well! This
          might include supplying raw materials like sheet metal or wood,
          providing key robot parts like electronics or pneumatics, machining or
          printing services, or catering for an event.

          <p>
            Any resources that you help provide will be directly used to help
            support the various activities that we do! Our funds will be spent
            on many needs, including the ones listed on the right. Additionally,
            any extra money raised will go towards helping decreasing member
            registration costs, making what we do more accessible to everyone
            and reducing the individual financial burdens on members.
