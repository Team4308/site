                            The only thing stronger than Percy’s jawline is his dedication to robotics. He’s got this
                            passion that motivates the whole team and he teaches the entire club so much. Percy’s so
                            crazy smart, you could probably ask him anything and he’d know the answer (unless it’s how
                            to put in a jigsaw blade), but on top of that he’ll listen to you and value what you have to
                            share. Not only does he strive for greatness in 4308 but he helps everyone on the team to be
                            great as well and I’m happy to call him our president!

                            Keeping things running smoothly in our biggest subteam is no easy feat, but Rebecca makes it
                            look like a breeze. She's honestly a mechanical pro. With the right tools, she could
                            probably get you to the moon. Or actually create non-sketchy bumpers. Really, if you ever
                            need help, or if something breaks, you know you can count on her, because she somehow has
                            pretty much all the answers, and she's always willing to lend a hand. On top of all that,
                            she knows first aid, so if (hypothetically) you ever cut your hand (not me), she's got your
                            back.

                            Not only is Danny the chillest person I’ve ever met (and probably will ever meet), you also
                            know you could always count on him. As this year’s mechanical lead, Danny’s the guy who
                            makes sure both the robot and practice bots are safe to mess with during meetings. You could
                            also see him around helping and teaching others all the time with patience. On top of that,
                            Danny always has the perfect solution to your mechanical problem. And if you ever have a
                            question, you know that he’s gotchu! Danny’s always willing to help out just like how he
                            once ate 8 hot dogs in a row - without hesitation :)

                            Nikhil is the current head of the design, and unlike me, he is actually a knowledgeable and
                            productive member of the team. Despite being in Mechanical for his first two years, Nikhil
                            has smoothly made the transition from building designs to creating them himself. He is also
                            one of the calmest and helpful people I know (How he has not mentally snapped despite
                            sitting next to me for an entire semester is beyond me). But for real, Nikhil is definitely
                            one of the smartest people I know and will be a key member over the next two years.

                            Tai for anything electrical in this club. Out of all Friday night meetings I’ve attended for
                            over 2 years, I can confidently say that Justin is the most dedicated member to electrical.
                            He was always keen on learning/helping with the electrical subteam, ever since day one, and
                            if there was one person I would pick to have electrical’s back, it would be Justin Tai.

                            don’t know what else to say about him but go talk to him and find out more about him

                            If I'm a 'total nerd' and 'intellectual genius' then Elisa is totally extra. Math Club
                            copres since grade 10, multiple AP exams since Grade 9, summer schooling in America, she
                            goes way above and beyond and I'm honestly kinda scared of her. Also the best webdev I know;
                            the team's website and scouting system would be nothing without her. She'll be crucial to
                            the team as a Scouting Lead and one of the members of our programming team. I've worked with
                            her on Math Club, Robotics, Hackathons and competition stuff and I know I can count on her
                            since she's the most reliable person I know.

                            year’s scouting leads, he’ll help you out with your mechanical needs too. You can discuss a
                            variety of things with the man, whether it's the new supreme drop or cs:go. Randy is also a
                            big eater, catch him going to those restaurants during competition break time. This guy is
                            literally the g.o.a.t. of the club, and you can follow his tik tok @ randy.03d

                            definitely my sister in spirit. Rakhee is relatable, fun to be around, and never afraid to
                            speak her mind. As this year's Admin lead, I know that she'll make sure that all important
                            tasks get done, and ensure that the team is a welcoming environment with something for
                            everyone. Rakhee is always willing to help out, and is all-around ABSOLUTEly amazing. ❤ And
                            if you ever spontaneously need 17 hair ties, she's your girl!!

                            If you don’t know Victor he probably intimidates you because he’s so freaking tall. But
                            having known him for a few years now, I know that he is so much more than that. He is fun
                            and smiley and an all around cool bean. Additionally, he is an essential member of our admin
                            team and his outreach skills reach further than anyone else on the team ;) Knowing him I can
                            say with ABSOLUTE certainty that our team would not be the same without him.
